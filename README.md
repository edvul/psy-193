# psy-193
Code for Psych 193 (visual cognition lab course) experiments

## Getting set up with python + pygame to run the experiments
This is sometimes a bit of a pain in the neck, especially for Mac systems.

### Windows
The instructions here are quite adequate

This amounts to downloading the Python installer, and the pygame installer, running the Python installer first, then the pygame installer.

### Mac OS X
This is an ordeal.  
The installation notes here: 
http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?showpart=0 

are a good start, but step 7 can be compressed to 
`pip3 install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame`

### Verification
If all works well, you should be able to run python3 in a terminal / command window and type `import pygame` without it giving you an error message.

## Making the scripts work on your computers
download the script from the appropriate directory
set up the same subdirectory structure on your machine
run with `python [scriptname]`
